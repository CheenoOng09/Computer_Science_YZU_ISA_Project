# Computer_Science_YZU_ISA_Project
YZU-ISA Assembly Projects – Intro to Computer Science. A 3-part project using YZU-ISA assembly language to solve computational problems. Includes a provided problem solution (Part 1), a self-proposed problem (Part 2), and its implementation (Part 3) using basic assembly operations like LOAD, STORE, conditional jumps, and arithmetic instructions.

# Intro to Computer Science – YZU-ISA Assembly Projects

This repository contains a 3-part assignment completed as part of the *Intro to Computer Science* course. All tasks were implemented using **YZU-ISA**, a custom educational assembly language designed for learning fundamental programming and computer architecture concepts.

## Contents

### Part 1 – Solving a Given Problem: Second Largest Number

- Implements an assembly program that finds the second largest number in a list of integers.
- Handles multiple test cases and input with duplicate values.
- Full documentation and screenshots provided.

### Part 2 – Proposed Problem: Average of Odd and Even Numbers

- Proposal to create a program that calculates the average of all odd and even numbers from a given list.
- The goal is to demonstrate understanding of control flow, counters, and conditional logic using YZU-ISA instructions.

**Files:**
- `Part2_Average_Odd_Even/1103558_Project Proposal` – Proposed problem specification

### Part 3 – Implementation of Proposed Problem

- Assembly program that reads a list of integers, separates them into odd and even, and computes the average for both categories.
- Result is displayed clearly to verify correctness.
